## WHAT IS THIS?

A web app for browsing and saving Youtube videos.
Backend is a simple webpack dev server, and frontend is done with React/Redux.
Autocomplete might be a bit slow, since requests are sent through external CORS proxy server

## HOW DO I RUN IT?

```
git clone https://github.com/Pekmen/youtube-search.git
cd youtube-search
npm install
npm run start
```
Open your browser and navigate to localhost:8080

For webpack building type:
```
npm run build
```
